The D-Link DSL-2600U model has different hardware variants (e.g. Z1 and Z2). If you downloaded the wrong firmware variant from the D-Link support website and updated your router and the router won't boot anymore, it's possible to bring this old router once again to life.

## Preparation

You need a USB to Serial adapter (mine is [Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41)). Open the router case and connect the `GND` adapter's pin to the `GND` port on the router's board, `Tx` to the `Rx` and `Rx` to the `Tx`.

## Setting up the environment

Make sure that you've installed the adapter drivers and connected the adapter to your system's USB port. Download [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm) and run it. In the application, open a new serial connection to the router, and from the `Setup > Serial Port` menu, change the "Baud rate / Speed" to 115200.  
You should see the following output on the console when turning the router on.

```

## Flashing the chipset

Turn off the router, press and hold the reset button and then press the power button to turn the device on. If you see the following output on the console, you've successfully booted into the SoC bootloader.

```

On the console, press the `x` key and from the `File > Transfer > XMODEM > Send...` menu, send the [recovery.img](recovery.img) file to the router. The router will reboot to the recovery image after the upload process is done.

You can type `help` to see the available commands.  
Now it's time to rewrite the flash chip. Type the `xmdm 80300000 200000` command and hit enter. After that, from the `File > Transfer > XMODEM > Send...` menu, upload the [flash.bin](flash.bin) (firmware version is 1.08 and it's for the Z2 variantâ€”I don't have the Z1 variant) file to the router volatile memory.

```
cmd > xmdm 80300000 200000
CCCreceived len=200000
```

Then, you can write the uploaded flash file with the `flash 0 80300000 200000` command to the chipset.

```
cmd > flash 0 80300000 200000

All done! Just reboot the router, and now you should see the complete bootlog on the console.
